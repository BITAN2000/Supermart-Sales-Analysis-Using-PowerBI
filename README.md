**	INFERENCE :-**
We wanted to analyze the key features and trends of the sales dataset of a Supermart based on which we could determine the financial condition and draw insights regarding the same. In my analysis, I have tried to add knowledge about sales and profit values based on category and subcategory in different regions.
I tried to analyze the impact of sales and profit by different categories of product using pie chart, donut chart, waterfall chart, line chart and also by a table which will also help the company to know the total profit and total sales. In this dashboard, company can filter the visuals by quantity, order date and sales.
